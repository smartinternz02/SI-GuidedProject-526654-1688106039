### Greetings to evaluator!

This repository holds the work we have completed as part of the Data Analytics Summer Internship program under Smart Bridge. In the **_Assignments.zip_** we have uploaded all the assignment 
files of each team member.

<br>

The **_Project Files.zip_** contains the below folders

 1. The source code of our project website is in the **_Web Interface Implementation_** folder along with flask deployment code and websites assets.
 2. The datasets we have used for analysis is in the **_Datasets_** folder.
 3. The tableau workbooks in packaged form are in **_Workbooks_** folder along with the **_Dashboard Background Images_** folder which contains the background images we used for dashboards.

<br>

The demo video of our project couldn't be uploaded here due to size constraints so we have pasted the google drive link of it in **_Demo link.txt_** file. In the **_Project Report.pdf_**, 
Appendix section has the google drive links to the following

  1. Project demo video.
  2. A folder containing the video demonstration of each project step we carried out.
  3. A folder containing all files related to web interface implementation. 

<br>

The **Performance Testing** step of the project isn't covered in separate video demonstration, rather in the video demonstration of visualisations we have demonstrated the 
process of creating the filters required for the visualisations. And with respect to calculated fields, we haven't created any because our dataset gave the information directly 
without the need to make a separate calculated field, also as our project dataset consisted more of text and ID fields and less of numerical fields, we didn't require calculated fields. 

We created a total of 16 unique visualisations, 3 filters- Season, Characters and Locations, 4 dashboards and 1 story. We used MySQL to connect our datasets with tableau. The packaged 
workbook might ask for password, but if the connection is given appropriately to the datasets we have uploaded, all our individual visualisations, dashboards and stories will be visible.
But to present our datasets to you without need of connecting to datasets, we are attaching the links to dashboards and story below.

We have tried to consolidate work in the best possible manner. And we have also tried to give references and credits to the resources we have used wherever necessary. In case of any 
unchecked error, we apologize for it. We would like to thank Smart Bridge for giving this opportunity to explore and expand our skill set.
