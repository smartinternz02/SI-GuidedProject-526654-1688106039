A note to evaluators,

The Performance Testing step of the project included No. of Filters and Calculated Fields. In the project demonstration video steps separate isn't created for this step,
rather the addition of filter is covered while explaining the visualisations itself, I request the evaluators to please look into it. And with respect to the calcualted 
fields we didn't find a need to do one because all the numeric values were direct in the datasets.
